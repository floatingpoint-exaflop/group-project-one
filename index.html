            Rules of War
        </h2>
        <p>
            The deck is divided equally among the two players, with each player receiving a face-down stack
        </p>
        <p>
            Players simultaneously flip the top card of their deck, also known as a "battle"
        </p>
        <p>
            The player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them face down at the bottom of their stack
        </p>
        <p>
            If the cards are the same rank, it's "war"
        </p>
        <p>
            Both players place the next card from their pile face down and then another card face up
        </p>
        <p>
            The player with the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck
        </p>
        <p>
            If players flip over cards of the same rank, a "war" is played
        </p>
        <p>
            During a "war", each player turns up one card face down and one card face up
        </p>
        <p>
            The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards)
        </p>
        <p>
            If a player runs out of cards in the middle of a "war", they lose the war and are out of the game
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, they can turn their last card face up, and these count as their played card in the war
        </p>
        <p>
            The game continues until one player wins all the cards from the table
